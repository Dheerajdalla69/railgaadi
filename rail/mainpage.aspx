        INTRODUCTION ABOUT RAILWAY</p>
    <p class="style3">
        Indian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned 
        and operated by the government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is 
        one of the world&#39;s largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km (71,000 mi) of 
        track over a route of 65,000 km (40,000 mi) and 7,500 stations. As of December 
        2012, it transported over 25 million passengers daily (over 9 billion on an 
        annual basis). In 2011, IR carried over 8,900 million passengers annually or 
        more than 24 million passengers daily (roughly half of which were suburban 
        passengers) and 2.8 million tons of freight daily. In 2011-2012 Indian Railways 
        earned INR104,278.79 crore (US$18.98 billion) which consists of INR69,675.97 
        crore (US$12.68 billion) from freight and INR28,645.52 crore (US$5.21 billion) 
        from passengers tickets. Railways were first introduced to India in 1853 from 
        Bombay to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalized as one unit, the Indian 
        Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both 
        long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre 
        and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at 
        several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of 
        power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty four states and three 
        union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, 
        Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian Railways is the world&#39;s ninth largest commercial 
        or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.4 million employees. As 
        for rolling stock, IR holds over 229,381 Freight Wagons, 59,713 Passenger 
        Coaches and 9,213 Locomotives. The trains have a 5 digit numbering system as the 
        Indian Railways runs about 10,000 trains daily. As of 31 March 2012, 22,224 km 
        (13,809 mi) (34%) of the total 65,000 km (40,000 mi) km route length was 
        electrified.[4] Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 
        Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.</p>
